## Who is it for?
- Are you a TU Delft researcher working actively with code as part of your research?
- Do you wish you could re-run your own code after a few months?
- Do you find it challenging to collaborate with colleagues when developing your code?
- Do you wish you could automate your work better?
- Would you like to learn to adopt best practices to increase your coding productivity, and write more robust, reusable, and easy-to-share code?

The TU Delft Digital Competence Centre (DCC) is offering a 13-week **FAIR for Research Software Program** (FAIR4RS program) that aims to teach you the essential tools to create scientific software following the FAIR principles and how to apply them to your own project.
