## Assignments for Wednesday 5th of April
We recommend you to go through the assignments in order to prepare for the next seminar on **Wednesday 5th of April**. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the components for creating FAIR research software and drafting a Software Management Plan.

### Assignment 1. Understanding your needs 
Fill in this short form to help us (and yourself) better understand your needs and where are you currently standing in your project. Please go to our [**FAIR4RS onboarding form**](https://forms.gle/hYbABeJYsgcqPihHA).

### Assignment 2. Reflect on your research software

1. Create a personal FAIR4RS journal (Hackmd document) using this [**template**](https://hackmd.io/@fair4rs/S1J84Mzg3). In this journal, you can track your progress in a shareable way.
    1. Create an account on Hackmd 
    2. Create a new note
    3. Copy-paste the content of the template

:::{info}
:information_source: **Why do we chose this tool?** 
Hackmd is based on markdown, it is highly accessible, collaborative and has a very low friction to use. Be aware, you are making use of a public service, only share things you feel are not an issue to have in the public domain.
:::

2. Read the [**Zen of Scientific computing**](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/zen-of-scicomp/) to find out about iteratively improving your software. The discussed levels are related to the lessons of the Code Refinery.


### Assignment 3. Draft an initial Software Management Plan

Create a draft for a software management plan (SMP) using one of the following templates in your FAIR4RS journal.

:::{hint}
Don't worry if you can't answer all the questions, this is a living document. You can iterate over this draft as we move along the program.
:::

Most likely, SMP template 1 (medium management level) is most suitable for a typical research software project. If you identify your software management level is lower or higher, then pick one of the other templates. Try to use the template as a guide, if you find that other points that appear in the template for high level management, you can also add them to your SMP.

:::{info}
:information_source: The templates are directly taken from the [Practical guide to Software Management Plans](https://zenodo.org/record/7589725). You can read more about the different management levels there.
:::

#### SMP template #1 - medium management level

```
1. Please provide a brief description of your software, stating its purpose
and intended audience.

9. How will your software be documented for future developers?

10. How will your software be tested? Please provide a link to the
automated testing results.

11. How will you check that your software respects the licences of
libraries and dependencies it uses?

```

#### SMP template #2 - low management level

```
