# Communication

During the FAIR4RS program, we encourage participants to collaborate and share their progress. To enable this, we will make use of MS Teams for most of our online interaction.

## MS Teams - FAIR4RS

Most of the communication will take place through the [FAIR4RS MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3advjoapU1agYypmcBSCsL4uQgk00zhWhUSSLbKyEsWjg1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=c94fd3be-2ec0-4e4e-a602-f11eab3fc745&tenantId=096e524d-6929-4030-8cd3-8ab42de0887b). We will use the following channels to organize our online interaction:

### General
- Main communication channel of the FAIR4RS program (we want to avoid unnecessary emails)
- This channel will provide updates and reminders on the program, schedule, and assignments.
- A Tab called "FAIR4RS" will link to the Hackmd materials.

### Questions and issues
- Ask questions to your cohort and the DCC helpers about any issues you encounter.

### Share and showcase
- Share any tips and tricks you come across
- Showcase the progress you made on your project

## Hackmd notes
All developed materials, seminar meeting notes, and assignments, are collected in our [Hackmd documents](https://hackmd.io/@mwakok/ry0Jusi85). 

## DCC mailbox
For personal and administrative questions, or the reporting of [Code of Conduct](/tMtAgds8QpyI1xGZrh9BjA) violations, you can reach us via dcc@tudelft.nl
