# Week 4 - Project planning

:::{admonition} Today's learning objectives
**Topics for today:**
- Reflect on the status of your project with respect to the Code Refinery lessons
- Define your project goals
- Introduce project planning with GitHub project boards

**What to expect**  
By the end of this seminar and by completing the assignments, you will put your project under version control, upload it to GitHub, and create a roadmap with actionable steps using issues and a project board.

## Introduction to project planning 
If you plan a large piece of work in your project, it is a good idea to produce an outline of the work. Your roadmap should cover your goal and vision and include a timeline for tasks that need to be completed, thus helping yourself and your collaborators to get an understanding of what is currently happening on the project and whatâ€™s coming next.

To create a roadmap, it is important to map out the key milestones, tasks needed to accomplish the milestones and related challenges to help you allocate your resources and time to work on them efficiently. 

### Creating a roadmap
Write a simple roadmap composed of milestones. You can use this draft roadmap to translate the requirements/considerations captured in your SMP into more actionable information.
1. Draft your first roadmap in your FAIR journal.

:::{tip}
- Use the insights you have captured in your SMP template to identify milestones
- If you would like to get feedback on your roadmap, you can share it as issue in your repository.
- Consider all kinds of aspects that are relevant to your project from writing code to publishing and training.
:::

**Example of milestones for a roadmap:**
```
## Roadmap milestones
- Refactor my codebase and add integration and unit tests 
- Create a website with documentation, contribution guidelines, and tutorials
- Make my codebase available to students in an upcoming course
- Release a first prototype that can be tested by (external) colleagues by mid 2023
- Optimize my code for execution on an cluster
- Publish paper by end 2023
```

## Assignments for Friday 14th of April

**Prerequisites:**
:::{warning}
- [ ] Check that everyone can follow the program on Github.
- [ ] We recommend to first create a **private repostory** that you will subsequently prepare for publishing during the program.
- [ ] Check that there are no major issues in making your project public. 
    - Are there any privacy or confidentiality concerns in your project?
    - Do you need a particular license?
    - Are there obstacles that may not allow you to make it open for FAIR and open science?

### Follow along demo: How to use github boards
We will demonstrate and discuss how to use GitHub project board to planning and organizing your project. Have a look how others are using project boards on GitHub: [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray), [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib).

:::{admonition} Instructor notes
:class: dropdown

- Tools integrated to project management:
    - Github boards. Brief comment on Kanban and different styles.
    - Milestones, issues, notes, tasks
    - Pull requests and reviews
    - Roles and assignment of tasks
    - Roadmaps
- Showcase a minimum GitHub planning workflow.
- Discuss a more advanced scenario.
:::


### Assignment 1
1. Create your private project repository on GitHub
2. Create a project board
3. Create a new issue using the **FAIR card** below and add it to the ToDo column.

:::{tip}
During each seminar, we will share a **FAIR card** with essential and recommended practices for the topic.
:::
 

**FAIR card: Version control**
```markdown
_Essential_  
- [ ] Use [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git) as a version control system 
- [ ] Upload your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [TU Delft GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/)

_Recommended_  
- [ ] Make your repository [public](https://coderefinery.github.io/social-coding/)
- [ ] [Branch hygiene](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-branch-design/)
- [ ] [Meaningful commit messages](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines)
```

### Assignment 2
1. Populate your board with your project goals in the form of issues/notes.
    - Define your milestones in GitHub
    - Add issues to your milestones
    - Add the issues to your project board
    - Consider creating task lists in your issue

:::{note}
**Things to consider**
- Modify your github board to reflect a workflow that matches the level of complexity of your project.
- How will you differentiate between an idea, bug, task, or feature? What labels will you use?
- If you are collaborating, how will issues be assigned?
:::

### Assignment 3 
_For those who don't have their project on Github_

1. Prepare your project for pushing to GitHub
    - Create a local repository
    - Which files will you track?
    - Which files will need to be ignored (see .gitignore)?
2. Push your local repository to GitHub
