# Code of Conduct
As a community we welcome everyone, and encourage a friendly and positive environment.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our Code of Conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be banned from the community.

In addition to this Code of Conduct, we expect all participants to adhere to the [TU Delft Code of Conduct](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/strategy/integrity-policy/tu-delft-code-of-conduct/) and the [TU Delft Regulations for Complaints Concerning Undesirable Behaviour](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Over_TU_Delft/Strategie/Integriteitsbeleid/TU%20Delft%20Regulations%20for%20Complaints%20Concerning%20Undesirable%20Behaviour.pdf).

## Our Pledge

We as organizers, contributors, and participants pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Spam or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the community
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Community leaders and event organizers will also discuss with the complainant whether they wish to contact the confidential advisor(s) at the TU Delft. The alleged perpetrator(s) will be notified of a complaint as soon as possible, and be given a chance to respond to the complaint.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.


### Reporting 
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting the organisers - José, Meta, and Maurits - either in person or electronically (dcc@tudelft.nl), with the option to remain anonymous.

If the person you should report to is the target of the complaint, pleaseo report an issue involving one of the members, please email one of the other members individually. Alternatively, you may contact the TU Delft External Confidential Advisor.

All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.

- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what
  occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
  available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please
  include a link.

- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the
incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how
to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team,
they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a  different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality  requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
