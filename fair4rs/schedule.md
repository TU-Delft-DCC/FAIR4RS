The FAIR4RS Program is a 13-week program on learning and applying tools and best-practices for research software development following the FAIR principles. The program will be hosted **in-person** at the TU Delft.

The FAIR4RS program consists of these main parts:

- Participants will join a Code Refinery workshop that takes place in six half-days, 21-23 & 28-30 March 2023.
- Participants join weekly sessions to practice applying the Code Refinery lessons to their own research project. Each session will focus on a particular topic.
- Week 11 and 12 are scheduled for participants to work on their own project goals.
- A final event will conclude the program, where the results of each project will be shared.
